# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C according to the syllabus prescribed by **APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University** for the course **CSL203 (DATA STRUCTURES LAB)**.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `dsa/`: Contains C files implementing various data structures and algorithms.
- `.vscode/`: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

## Running the Code

To run any of the C files, use a C compiler such as gcc. For example, to compile and run `doublyLinkedList.c`, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc dsa/doublyLinkedList.c -o doublyLinkedList
./doublyLinkedList
```
